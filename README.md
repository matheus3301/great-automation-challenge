### Environment Setup

#### Pre-requisites

- You must be running Windows
- Java Development Kit
- Eclipse IDE

#### Setup

1 - Download the Chrome Web Driver clicking [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (
select a version according to your browser version )

2 - Put the 'chromedriver.exe' on 'C:\\'

3 - Clone this project on your IDE

3 - Open the project and go to 'src/test/java/singup' path

4 - Now you can run SingupTest as a JUnit Test

### Executing the Project

If the code runs as expected, it'll open your Chrome and follow the Sing Up steps. To change the account creation email, you can change the value of email variable.
